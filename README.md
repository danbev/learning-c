## Learning C
The sole purpose of this project is to learn c and experiment with various system calls.


### Inheritance
A simple example of how struct inheritance works in C
```shell
$ make inherit
$ ./inherit
```

### kqueue example.
A simple example that uses kqueue to monitor a file named ```test.txt``` for updates and deletion.

```shell
$ make kqueue
$ touch test.txt
$ ./kq
```
You can now update ```test.txt``` to and notice that the program will log that this has happend.
Deleting the file will cause the program to exit.

### pthreads example
A simple example using pthreads
```shell
$ make pthreads
$ ./pthreads
```

### variadic example
Example of using variable arguments to a function
```shell
$ make variadic
$ ./var
```

### Header files on Mac
If you go searching for headers files on Mac and look in ```/usr/include``` you might find that directory empty. 
You'll need to install the command line tools using:
```shell
$ xcode-select --install
```

### Socket server and client
```shell
$ make server-socket
$ ./server-socket
````

```shell
$ make client-socket
$ ./client-socket
```

When the client disconnects there are zombies left on the server side:
```shell
$ ps -t ttys018 -o pid,ppid,tty,stat,args,wchan
  PID  PPID TTY      STAT ARGS            WCHAN
  15071   381 ttys018  Ss   -/bin/bash      -
  89040 15071 ttys018  S+   ./server-socket -
  89044 89040 ttys018  Z+   (server-socket) -
  89054 89040 ttys018  Z+   (server-socket) -
  89057 89040 ttys018  Z+   (server-socket) -
  89060 89040 ttys018  Z+   (server-socket) -
  89062 89040 ttys018  Z+   (server-socket) -
  89064 89040 ttys018  Z+   (server-socket) -
  89066 89040 ttys018  Z+   (server-socket) -
```
These need to be cleand up properly. This was before any signal handlers were added to the example.


### Signals
Just to try out signal handling.

```shell
  $ make signals
  $ ./signals
```

From a different shell run:
```shell
  $ ps -ef |grep signal
  $ kill -USR1 pid
  $ kill -USR2 pid
```
